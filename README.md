# 🛒 Superstore Sales Analysis

This project performs an end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Superstore sales data using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains records of customer orders from a fictional superstore, including:

- Order ID, Product Name, Category & Sub-category
- Sales, Ship Mode, Region, Customer Segment
- Order Date, Ship Date

> ✅ A `Profit` column was calculated assuming 70% cost on each sale (as cost info was not given).

---

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed

- 🔍 **Sales and Profit by Category & Sub-Category**
- 🌍 **Regional and Segment-wise Performance**
- 📈 **Monthly Sales Trends**
- 💸 **Sales vs Profit Scatterplot**
- 🥇 **Top 10 Most Profitable Products**

---

## 📌 Insights

- 📦 **Technology** is the most profitable category.
- ⚠️ **Tables** have high sales but generate losses — possibly due to pricing issues.
- 🌐 **West region** and **Consumer segment** are most profitable.
- 📉 High **Sales** ≠ always high **Profit** — optimize cost margins.
